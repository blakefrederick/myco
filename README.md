## Cross-Platform Messaging

Next.js 13 + Tailwind CSS + Upstash + Redis + Pusher + NextAuth + Facebook, Github, Twitter Authentication

Yet another project to practice new things and reinforce existing things. Props to Sonny Sangha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2jKJF4BZOY

Features may include:

Authenticate with different platforms to apply different message background colours (very important).

Sign in with Facebook >> blue messages<br/>
Sign in with Github >> grey messages<br/>
Sign in with Twitter >> sky blue messages

Messages are ephemeral. After 100 seconds of chat inactivity, the entire chat history is wiped from storage. [Currently disabled for testing purposes]

A stream of annoying notifications to entice you back to the app upon leaving. [Currently enabled for learning purposes]

A replica of the Twitter heart animation (web version) to like messages. [Testing]
